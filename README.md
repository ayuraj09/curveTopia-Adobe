# CURVETOPIA: A Journey into the World of Curves

## Project Overview
CURVETOPIA is a project focused on identifying, regularizing, and beautifying 2D curves. Starting with closed curves, the project will progressively handle more complex shapes and incorporate techniques for symmetry and curve completion.

## Objective
Transform input polylines into a set of connected cubic BÃ©zier curves. Initially, the project will simplify the process by using polylines as input instead of raster images, with the ultimate goal of converting these polylines into smooth, aesthetically pleasing curves.

## Technologies Used
- **Programming Language**: Python
- **Libraries**: OpenCV, NumPy, Matplotlib
- **Formats**: SVG for visualization`
